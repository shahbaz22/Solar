Completed repository for multi-layer model; includes code for 2-layer and 3-layer code for comparison and varification of multi-layer code.

All multi-layer codes take an array of alpha values and an array of r values (excluding 0) as inputs. Multi-layer codes have been verified using two and three layer models in repo.

Multi-layer codes:
dk.py (Change in helicty)
bfields.py (Continuos bfields)
